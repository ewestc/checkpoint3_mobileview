      <div class="grid-item grid-item-1">
        <p>Honestly, I was shocked when I realized how many running specific books that I have read. Here are just a few of my favorite running books with a brief description.</p>
      </div>

      <div class ="grid-item grid-item-2">
        <h2>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running: A Memoir By Haruki Murakami</h2><br>
        <p>I’ve read a few Murakami novels and picked up this book in part because I was curious about his take on non fiction and also, curious about his private passion for running. Over the span of his writing career, this guy has also run over 20 marathons and even an ultramarathon! This book is about how his two passions for running and creative work influence each other.</p>

      <div class ="grid-item grid-item-4">
        <h2>Born to Run by By Christopher McDougall</h2><br>
        <p>Of all the books on this list, this book was the one that made me the most proud of being a runner. It inspires you to run with stories about how the sport is about defying your limitations.</p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class ="grid-item grid-item-6">
        <h2>Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins</h2><br>
        <p> Running is more a mental test than an athletic endeavor. David Goggins is an ultrarunner, navy seal, and triathlete. He talks about how mental perseverance carried him through the toughest challenges in his life, both on and off the running trails.</p>

      <div class ="grid-item grid-item-8">
        <h2>Shoe Dog by Phil Knight</h2><br>
        <p>I love autobiographies, especially if they are from entrepreneurs, and so a book about the origin story of a company that I admire and that just so happens to be one of the most respected athletic and running companies in the world, is my ideal book.</p>

      <div class ="grid-item grid-item-10">
        <h2>Non Runner’s Marathon Running Guide by Dawn Dais</h2><br>
        <p>This is the book that got me into marathon running. If you follow everything in this book, you will run your first marathon, guaranteed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-item grid-item-11">

      <div class ="grid-item grid-item-12">
        <h2>Eat and Run By Scott Jurek</h2><br>
        <p>Scott Jurek is the most famous ultrarunner of his generation. This book combines practice plant-based recipes that fuel his runs with stories about his running journey and how he trains his mind to keep pushing on 100, 200 mile runs. Dude’s insane and inspirational.</p>
